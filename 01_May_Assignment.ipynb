    "An extrinsic measure is an evaluation approach used in natural language processing (NLP) to assess the performance of language models in the context of a specific downstream task. Unlike intrinsic measures, which evaluate models based on their internal characteristics, extrinsic measures focus on how well a model's outputs contribute to the quality of the final task's results.\n",
